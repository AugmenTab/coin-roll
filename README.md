# Coin Roll

This application is a proof-of-concept for a customizable cryptocurrency dashboard. It allows the user to search a database of cryptocurrencies and create their own watchlist of those that interest them. Their watchlist provides current financial and portfolio information on the cryptocurrencies in their watchlist. They can also insert a transaction record, a purchase or a sell, and see a summary of their portfolio that includes data like their current investment's value and the profit they've made so far, on both a per-cryptocurrency and overall scale.
